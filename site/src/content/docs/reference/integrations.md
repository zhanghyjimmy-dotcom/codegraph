description: Supported agents, and manual MCP setup.
---

The interactive installer auto-detects and configures each supported agent — wiring the CodeGraph MCP server into each. For the agents that use an instructions file, it also writes a short marker-fenced CodeGraph section (`AGENTS.md` or `GEMINI.md`) so subagents and non-MCP harnesses learn the `codegraph explore` command; `codegraph uninstall` removes it.

## Supported agents

- **Cursor**
- **Codex CLI**
- **opencode**
- **Hermes Agent**
- **Gemini CLI**
- **Antigravity IDE**
- **Kiro**

Run `npx @colbymchenry/codegraph` and pick your agent(s); see [Installation](/codegraph/getting-started/installation/) for the non-interactive flags.

## Manual setup

If you'd rather wire it up yourself, install globally:

```bash
npm install -g @colbymchenry/codegraph
```

Add the MCP server to your agent's MCP config (e.g. `~/.cursor/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "codegraph": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "codegraph",
      "args": ["serve", "--mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

`codegraph install --print-config <id>` prints the exact snippet for any supported agent.

:::tip
Cursor launches MCP subprocesses with the wrong working directory. The installer handles this for you by injecting a `--path` argument; if you wire Cursor up by hand, pass the project path explicitly.
